# Open Space
You can see the live preview of this project [here](https://ayushnagarcodes.github.io/Open-space/).
- It is a fun simulation of a rocket launch using HTML, CSS & JavaScript.
- How to launch the rocket?
  - First, you need to enter the password: LaunchIt
  - It will unlock some input sliders and checkboxes. The 'Launch' & 'Re-Launch' button are still locked.
  - All the checkboxes must be ticked and the sliders below it should be up to its max limit in order to unlock the 'Launch' button.
  - You can adjust the speed & the trajectory angle of the rocket.
  - Finally, press 'Launch'.
  - There will be a count-down and the rocket will be launched. You can try different combinations of speed & trajectory angle.
  - Click on 'Re-Launch' button to launch it again.
- It was a fun project and I learned a lot about postioning elements, transition & animation using CSS, DOM methods, etc.
